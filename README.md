Maze Solver in Python
This project solves a maze using classic search algorithms and visualizes the results.
The maze is read from a text file where:
A is the start
B is the goal
'#' is a wall
Any other character is a free cell
Implemented algorithms:
Depth First Search (DFS)
Breadth First Search (BFS)
Greedy Best First Search
A* Search
The program:
Finds a path from A to B
Prints the solution in the terminal
Generates images showing explored cells and the final path
Output images:
maze-dfs.png
maze-bfs.png
maze-greed.png
maze-a*.png
Requirements:
Python 3
Pillow library
Install dependency:
pip install pillow
Run:
python maze.py
This project is meant for learning AI search algorithms and pathfinding basics.
